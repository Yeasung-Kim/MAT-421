        "\n",
        "Simpson’s Rule is a method for approximating definite integrals by fitting quadratic polynomials to the function over pairs of subintervals. It requires that the number of subintervals be even (or, equivalently, the number of grid points be odd). The basic formula for Simpson’s Rule over an interval \\([a, b]\\) with \\(n\\) evenly spaced points is:\n",

        "\\[\n",

The method is more accurate than the trapezoidal rule because the quadratic fits better capture the curvature of many functions.\n",
