        "## 1. Introduction to the Problem\n",
        "Mathematical models have played a pivotal role in analyzing the spread of COVID-19 and forecasting disease dynamics. The classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model is often employed to describe disease transmission; however, this traditional form usually lacks a vaccination component. Given the real-world importance of vaccine campaigns, our project focuses on extending the SIR model to include a time-dependent vaccination parameter, which allows us to investigate how varying vaccination rates and efficacy influence the trajectory of an epidemic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, we will introduce a term representing the vaccinated population that transitions either to a recovered (immune) compartment or remains susceptible if the vaccine fails to induce immunity. Building on reference work in epidemiology (for example, *SIR Model of Time Dependent Drug and Vaccine Distribution on COVID-19*), we aim to study whether the timing of vaccine distribution (relative to the infection peak) can significantly mitigate the overall spread and the mortality rate of COVID-19. These insights are of central importance for public health policies seeking to optimize resource allocation and timing of vaccine rollouts.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Related Work\n",
        "The original SIR model by Kermack and McKendrick (1927) has been extended in numerous ways, such as the inclusion of asymptomatic carriers (SAIR), fatality compartments, and vaccine distributions. Recent research has highlighted two main themes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Time-Dependent Interventions**  \n",
        "   Various studies show that non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., vaccines and antivirals) are most effective when initiated before or near the beginning of an outbreak. In *SIR Model of Time Dependent Drug and Vaccine Distribution on COVID-19*, for instance, it was observed that drugs and vaccines have contrasting benefits depending on whether they are administered before or after the peak infection date.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Vaccination Efficacy and Coverage**  \n",
        "   Empirical data suggest that even partially effective vaccines can greatly reduce overall mortality if administered broadly and quickly. However, if a significant portion of the population has already been infected before the vaccine becomes available, the marginal benefit decreases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Taken together, these findings underscore the importance of modeling vaccination parameters not merely as constant rates but as functions of time, availability, and efficacy.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Proposed Methodology / Models\n",
        "We will begin with the classic SIR framework:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\frac{dS}{dt} = -\\beta\\,S\\,I, \\quad\n",
        "\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\beta\\,S\\,I \\;-\\;\\gamma\\,I, \\quad\n",
        "\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\gamma\\,I,\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where \\\\(S\\\\), \\\\(I\\\\), and \\\\(R\\\\) are the susceptible, infected, and recovered populations, respectively. The parameters \\\\(\\beta\\\\) (infection rate) and \\\\(\\gamma\\\\) (recovery rate) capture fundamental aspects of disease transmission.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Adding Vaccination\n",
        "To incorporate vaccination, we will introduce\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "v(t) = \\text{a time-dependent vaccination rate},\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "which removes individuals from the susceptible class and transitions them either to a fully recovered (immune) compartment \\\\(R\\\\) if the vaccine is effective or to a “still susceptible” compartment if the vaccine fails.\n",
        "\n",
        "One formulation inspired by *SIR Model of Time Dependent Drug and Vaccine Distribution on COVID-19* involves splitting \\\\(S\\\\) into two groups: those who remain truly susceptible \\\\(S\\\\) and those who receive an ineffective vaccine \\\\(S_{iv}\\\\). Meanwhile, effective vaccinations increase \\\\(R\\\\) directly. The resulting system can look like:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\begin{aligned}\n",
        "\\frac{dS}{dt} &= -\\beta \\,\\frac{I}{N}\\, S \\;-\\; v(t),\\\\\n",
        "\\frac{dS_{iv}}{dt} &= (1-\\kappa)\\,v(t) \\;-\\; \\beta \\,\\frac{I}{N}\\, S_{iv},\\\\\n",
        "\\frac{dI}{dt} &= \\beta \\,\\frac{I}{N}\\,(S + S_{iv}) \\;-\\; \\gamma\\,I,\\\\\n",
        "\\frac{dR}{dt} &= \\gamma\\,I \\;+\\; \\kappa\\,v(t),\n",
        "\\end{aligned}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where \\\\(\\kappa\\\\) is the vaccine effectiveness, and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) determines how many are vaccinated per unit time. We will refine these equations to reflect realistic boundary conditions (e.g., ensuring \\\\(S\\\\) never becomes negative) and possibly include a mortality compartment if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Equilibrium Analysis\n",
        "We will analyze the equilibrium points of the system (where \\\\(\\tfrac{dS}{dt} = \\tfrac{dI}{dt} = \\tfrac{dR}{dt} = \\dots = 0\\\\)) to determine conditions under which the disease dies out or becomes endemic. Examining the Jacobian matrix at equilibrium can reveal whether an equilibrium is stable or unstable. A key goal is to examine how the presence of vaccination shifts the threshold \\\\(R_0\\\\) for herd immunity.\n",

        "\n",
        "## 4. Experimental Setup\n",
        "We will simulate the above model in Python (Jupyter Notebook). Our plan includes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Parameter Estimation**  \n",
        "   We will use realistic estimates for \\\\(\\beta\\\\) and \\\\(\\gamma\\\\) from COVID-19 literature. Vaccine effectiveness \\\\(\\kappa\\\\) will be set to values between 50% and 95% to explore different scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Time-Dependent Vaccination Distribution**  \n",
        "   Following the approach in *SIR Model of Time Dependent Drug and Vaccine Distribution*, we may use a logistic function for \\\\(v(t)\\\\) to mimic a ramp-up period in vaccine availability.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Numerical Solver**  \n",
        "   We will use `solve_ivp` or a comparable ODE solver from the `SciPy` library. Parameter sweeps will be performed to compare outcomes under various vaccination rates and start times.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Data Sources**  \n",
        "   We will attempt to fit or validate certain parameters (like peak infection or population size) using publicly available COVID-19 data (e.g., from Kaggle or other open-data sources).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. Expected Results\n",
        "We anticipate that higher vaccination rates and earlier administration will reduce both the peak number of infections and the final total infections:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Peak Infection Reduction**: Timely vaccination is expected to flatten and push the infection peak to a later date with a lower magnitude.\n",
        "- **Mortality Decrease**: By decreasing the size of the infected population at any time, an effective vaccination campaign should lower cumulative mortality rates.\n",
        "- **Sensitivity to Start Date**: As highlighted in other studies, if vaccination starts after most of the population has already been infected, its impact diminishes drastically.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, an equilibrium analysis will likely show that the disease-free equilibrium becomes more stable as the fraction of effectively vaccinated individuals surpasses a threshold that leads to herd immunity.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "By extending the basic SIR framework to include a time-dependent vaccination rate, we will uncover important dynamics regarding the timing and magnitude of vaccination efforts. This work will demonstrate how even partial vaccine effectiveness, if deployed early enough, can have a substantial impact on reducing final infections and mortality. Conversely, delayed vaccination campaigns may fail to prevent large-scale outbreaks. We expect our numerical experiments and equilibrium analysis to align with the broader epidemiological consensus: that **strategic vaccine rollout** is among the most critical components of pandemic response.\n",
