        "This paper outlines the development of two models designed to quantify the **intrinsic value** of a batted ball.  \n",
        "The first model—originally created by *Dr. Glenn Healey*—maps a batted ball’s **speed**, **vertical angle**, and **horizontal angle** to an intrinsic value. However, this model tends to **underrate above-average runners** and **overrate below-average runners**.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address this limitation, a **second model** is introduced that **incorporates the batter’s sprint speed** into the mapping process.\n",

        "Visual representations of both models are provided:\n",

        "* the original **wOBA cube**, and  \n",
        "* the sprint-speed-enhanced **wOBA tesseract**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Model performance was assessed via the **mean absolute deviation (MAD)** between intrinsic values and an outcomes-based statistic. Results show the sprint-speed model is **at least as accurate** as the original.  \n",
        "Reliability, measured with **Cronbach’s α**, indicates both intrinsic models are similarly reliable and outperform the outcomes-based metric.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the paper identifies the ten most **overrated** and **underrated** players by comparing intrinsic and outcomes-based statistics. The analysis concludes that the sprint-speed model **reduces the tendency to underrate fast runners and overrate slower ones** compared with the original intrinsic model (Melville 2019).\n"

        "He demonstrated that this intrinsic-value statistic exhibited greater reliability than traditional outcomes-based statistics.\n",
        "In baseball, various external factors—such as defensive quality, ballpark dimensions, and weather conditions—can influence the outcome of a batted ball.\n",
        "By isolating what the batter controls, Healey’s intrinsic-value model provides a potentially improved method for evaluating hitters, independent of these confounding variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Healey’s model maps a batted-ball vector $x = (s,\\,v,\\,h)$ — where $s$ represents launch speed, $v$ is the vertical launch angle, and $h$ is the horizontal angle — to an intrinsic value.\n",
        "In an article for *The Hardball Times*\n",
        "<span style=\"font-size:0.85em;\">(Healey 2016)</span>,\n",
        "he observed that players with a significant discrepancy between their outcomes-based statistic $(O)$, measured by weighted on-base average on contact (wOBAcon), and their intrinsic value $(I)$ often exhibited above-average running speed.\n",
        "Conversely, players with smaller $O-I$ values tended to be slower runners\n",
        "<span style=\"font-size:0.85em;\">(Healey 2016; Slowinski 2010)</span>.\n",
        "This suggests that fast runners often outperform the expectations set by the intrinsic model, while slower runners struggle to meet them.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, a slow ground ball to third base holds different value depending on the batter’s speed—a fast runner may beat the throw to first, while a slower runner likely cannot.\n",
        "Similarly, speed allows certain players to stretch singles into doubles or doubles into triples, exceeding the model’s intrinsic-value predictions.\n",
        "These insights indicate that Healey’s model may underrate fast runners and overrate slow runners.\n",
        "To address this, an enhanced version of the intrinsic-value model that incorporates a player’s sprint speed is introduced in this paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this work, Healey’s original intrinsic-value statistic is referred to as $I_{ns}$, representing the model **without** a sprint-speed parameter.\n",

        "The notation $I(x)$ refers to the intrinsic value of a specific batted ball with vector $x$, while $I$ represents the player’s overall intrinsic-value statistic, averaged across all of their batted balls.\n",
        "Visual representations of $I_{ns}(x)$ and $I_s(x)$ across different launch angles are provided.\n",
        "Finally, the two intrinsic-value models are compared in terms of accuracy, reliability, and $O - I$ values, with $O$ denoting the outcomes-based statistic (wOBAcon) throughout this paper.\n"

        "\n",
        "In his article <span style=\"font-size:0.85em;\">(Healey 2017)</span>, Healey created a visual mapping from $(s,v,h)$ to the intrinsic value $I_{ns}(x)$, called the **wOBA cube**. Figure 1 presents a similar wOBA cube using **2024** data rather than the 2014 data that Healey used. Since the distance from home plate to the fence is typically shortest along the baselines $(h=\\pm45^\\circ)$, it is not surprising that Figure 1 suggests that, for a batted ball hit at **96 mph**, the highest intrinsic values occur when it is hit down the baselines ($h>40^\\circ$ or $h<-40^\\circ$) with a vertical launch angle $v$ between **25° and 35°**.\n",

        "The cold spots centered just below $v=20^\\circ$ with horizontal angles near $-30^\\circ$, $0^\\circ$, and $30^\\circ$ correspond to balls hit to the left-, center-, and right-fielders, which typically result in outs. Likewise, the cold spots below $v=0^\\circ$ centered around $h=-35^\\circ,\\,-15^\\circ,\\,20^\\circ,\\,40^\\circ$ represent ground balls fielded for outs by the third-baseman, shortstop, second-baseman, and first-baseman, respectively.\n",

Here, $O$ refers to the outcome statistic wOBA on contact, or $wOBA_{con}$. By introducing sprint speed as an additional parameter in calculating $I_s$, the aim was to preserve both the accuracy and reliability of the $I_{ns}$ model while eliminating the bias of undervaluing fast runners and overvaluing slower ones in terms of $O-I$. This section presents a comparison of the accuracy, reliability, and $O-I$ values of $I_{ns}$ and $I_s$.\n",

Using 2024 batted-ball data, the $I_{ns}$ values produced a MAD of approximately **0.0132**, while the $I_s$ values had a MAD of about **0.0115**. This indicates that the sprint-speed-adjusted intrinsic value is at least as accurate—if not slightly more accurate—than the non-sprint-speed version.

        "- **Variable Selection:** As more detailed Statcast data become available, we aim to partition datasets more selectively, using only variables most relevant to predicting intrinsic value. This could include context-specific features such as batted-ball spin rate or fielder positioning, rather than using every available variable uniformly.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dimensionality Management:** Incorporating additional variables raises concerns about data sparsity. Future work will focus on balancing model complexity by selectively including only the most impactful features—possibly through feature-selection algorithms or dimensionality-reduction techniques such as PCA.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Non-Diagonal Covariance Structures:** The current model assumes independent dimensions in the KDE kernel (diagonal covariance matrices). Relaxing this assumption could better capture correlations between variables such as launch angle and sprint speed, potentially improving model accuracy and reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Alternative Sprint-Speed Metrics:** The model currently uses Statcast’s sprint speed (feet per second in the fastest one-second window). Future versions will experiment with more accessible metrics—e.g., home-to-first time—making the model easier to apply to amateur or non-MLB players.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Updated Datasets:** As MLB continues to expand Statcast tracking, incorporating data from the 2025 season and beyond will be crucial to validate and refine the model, allowing us to test its generalizability and stability over time.\n",
